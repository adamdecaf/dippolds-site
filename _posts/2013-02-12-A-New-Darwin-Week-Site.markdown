title: A New Darwin Week Site

I had the privilege of serving as President of the [University of Northern Iowa Freethinkers & Inquirers](www.unifreethought.com) or just 'UNIFI'. Our annual flagship event is [Darwin Week](darwinweek.com) - a weeklong celebration of science, inquiry, and critical thought. It's essentially a conference for students on campus and the surrounding community with 3 faculty lectures each day, and a keynote lecture each evening. As part of the planning this year, we decided that our old site was ill-suited to our needs. Thank to the much appreciated design work of [Tyler Owen](http://tylerowen.info/), our site had looked a lot better last year than ever before - but there's only so much you can do to dress up a very plan Wordpress theme.

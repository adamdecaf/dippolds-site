		SO THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER THE HOOD, EH? FEEL FREE TO POKE AROUND!
		I TRIED TO KEEP MY CODE CLEAN, READABLE, AND WELL COMMENTED. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
		QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHOICES I HAVE MADE IN BUILDING THIS SITE, I'D GENUINELY
		LIKE TO HEAR THEM. ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, AND WANT TO DISCUSS
		EMPLOYMENT, I'D OBVIOUSLY LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

	<h4><a href="/articles/Redesigning-My-Site/">Redesigning My Site</a></h4>
	<p><p>I recently decided to redesign my website. Instead of completely scrapping what I had, I consider my new design an iteration of the previous version, with a slight shift in focus. My old site was supposed to function as a digital business card &ndash; minimal and elegant. I think I more or less achieved that, but I needed something with a little more content. Specifically, I need to be able to sell myself to potential employers or clients as a web professional.</p> <h1>Designing for My Goals</h1> <p>I have a &ldquo;blue&rdquo; problem, in that I always want to design in partially...</p>

	<p><p>I had the privilege of serving as President of the <a href="www.unifreethought.com">University of Northern Iowa Freethinkers &amp; Inquirers</a> or just &lsquo;UNIFI&rsquo;. Our annual flagship event is <a href="darwinweek.com">Darwin Week</a> &ndash; a weeklong celebration of science, inquiry, and critical thought. It&rsquo;s essentially a conference for students on campus and the surrounding community with 3 faculty lectures each day, and a keynote lecture each evening. As part of the planning this year, we decided that our old site was ill-suited to our needs. Thank to the much appreciated design work of <a href="http://tylerowen.info/">Tyler Owen</a>, our site had looked a lot better last...</p>

	<p><p><a href="http://onwithlife.org/">On With Life</a> is a brain injury rehab center, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Their site is an interesting case study in design gone wrong. It seems well built from a technical perspective. All of the elements of the site should probably be there. It has a mission statement, a media page, information about the organization, etc. So what happened?</p> <h1>The Big Picture</h1> <p>We can&rsquo;t know for sure what the designer intended, but each of their decisions gives us a little insight into what they were trying to do. The site is sectioned off into full-width containers that each...</p>

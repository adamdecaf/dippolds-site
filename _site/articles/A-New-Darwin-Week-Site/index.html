		SO THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER THE HOOD, EH? FEEL FREE TO POKE AROUND!
		I TRIED TO KEEP MY CODE CLEAN, READABLE, AND WELL COMMENTED. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
		QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHOICES I HAVE MADE IN BUILDING THIS SITE, I'D GENUINELY
		LIKE TO HEAR THEM. ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, AND WANT TO DISCUSS
		EMPLOYMENT, I'D OBVIOUSLY LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. 

		I'M MOST REACHABLE AT: MICHAEL.S.DIPPOLD AT GMAIL.COM

		THANKS FOR VISITING!

<h4><a href="">A New Darwin Week Site</a></h4s>
<h3>12 Feb 2013</h3>
<p>I had the privilege of serving as President of the <a href="www.unifreethought.com">University of Northern Iowa Freethinkers &amp; Inquirers</a> or just &lsquo;UNIFI&rsquo;. Our annual flagship event is <a href="darwinweek.com">Darwin Week</a> &ndash; a weeklong celebration of science, inquiry, and critical thought. It&rsquo;s essentially a conference for students on campus and the surrounding community with 3 faculty lectures each day, and a keynote lecture each evening. As part of the planning this year, we decided that our old site was ill-suited to our needs. Thank to the much appreciated design work of <a href="http://tylerowen.info/">Tyler Owen</a>, our site had looked a lot better last year than ever before &ndash; but there&rsquo;s only so much you can do to dress up a very plan Wordpress theme.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of serving as President of the <a href="www.unifreethought.com">University of Northern Iowa Freethinkers &amp; Inquirers</a> or just &lsquo;UNIFI&rsquo;. Our annual flagship event is <a href="darwinweek.com">Darwin Week</a> &ndash; a weeklong celebration of science, inquiry, and critical thought. It&rsquo;s essentially a conference for students on campus and the surrounding community with 3 faculty lectures each day, and a keynote lecture each evening. As part of the planning this year, we decided that our old site was ill-suited to our needs. Thank to the much appreciated design work of <a href="http://tylerowen.info/">Tyler Owen</a>, our site had looked a lot better last year than ever before &ndash; but there&rsquo;s only so much you can do to dress up a very plan Wordpress theme.</p>

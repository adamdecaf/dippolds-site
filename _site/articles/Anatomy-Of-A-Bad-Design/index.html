<p><a href="http://onwithlife.org/">On With Life</a> is a brain injury rehab center, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Their site is an interesting case study in design gone wrong. It seems well built from a technical perspective. All of the elements of the site should probably be there. It has a mission statement, a media page, information about the organization, etc. So what happened?</p>

<h1>The Big Picture</h1>

<p>We can&rsquo;t know for sure what the designer intended, but each of their decisions gives us a little insight into what they were trying to do. The site is sectioned off into full-width containers that each contain a different element of the site. A green section with the navigation and logo. A grey section with general information about the organization. A blue section with more information about their services. Another grey section with social media links. And finally, a giant green footer. This style of sectioning is gaining popularity right now because it&rsquo;s a visually interesting way to present information. The problem is that this format is totally inappropriate in the context of this organization. The style is generally used for designer portfolios, or sites that are less dense with information, and geared toward a younger audience. <a href="http://lorenzoverzini.com/">Here&rsquo;s a great example</a> of how effective this style can be in an appropriate context.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, the design is working <em>against</em> both its content and users, instead of for them. A site&rsquo;s design and layout should never put up barriers between users and the content they want to access. The confusing layout and poor use of white space make the site less easy to use, and that is a substantial problem.</p>

<p><strong>Talk more up here about the big picture with the layout. Include site pictures.</strong></p>

<h1>The Details</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a slightly less surface-level look at some of the problems with the design. First up, the color scheme. It&rsquo;s bad. I&rsquo;m not really qualified to give a lesson in color theory, so I won&rsquo;t try, but I will say that these particular colors &ndash; especially the pale green &ndash; are really unpleasant. Additionally, a quick inspection tells me that there are at least three different colors of blue on the page. The logo blue and the blue section do match, but the color really isn&rsquo;t as appropriate for use as a background as it is for use in the logo.</p>

<p>Another issue is the haphazard alignments. There is obviously a wrapper containing most of the elements, but the top navigation and lower social media buttons are both centered, for some reason. The navigation would look a lot cleaner if it were only on one line, and the whole site would look a lot better with more consistent alignment.</p>

<p>There is also a painful amount of redundancy on the page. The navigation is displayed again at the bottom for no real reason, significantly lengthening the page. All of the social media buttons are present twice, and they are too close together to argue that the goal was to ensure that people see them.</p>

<p>On pages outside of the home page, much of the content is contained within click-to-reveal boxes, which puts another barrier between the user and the content. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to ask the users to scroll a little, and even if you wanted to avoid that, there are ways to structure the information that don&rsquo;t rely on so much needless clicking.</p>

<p>Finally, the use of white space is really bad. White space is generally used to draw attention to important information, and give the design some room to breathe. There&rsquo;s a lot of unused space in the last three sections, and it&rsquo;s not really serving any particular goal. It seems to be a byproduct of the other design problems. There is no reason to have so much unused space in the blue section (especially with the awkwardly inconsistent length of the columns), and the sitemap adds way too much space to the footer.</p>

<h1>What should they be doing?</h1>

<p>Ultimately, a website should foster trust between the organization and the user. For many people, this will be their first impression of the organization. They may assume that the whole operation is as poorly organized as the website. If the site doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> professional, then they may assume the organization itself is not professional. The site must reflect the quality of the organization, and this design does <em>feel</em> professional in the way that it should.</p>

<p>If On With Life were to take my advice, I would suggest nuking this design from orbit and going back to the drawing board. For purposes of putting everything I have talked about into practice, let&rsquo;s talk about what the redesign process might look like.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s survey the competition. What works for them, and what could they improve on? A quick web search turns up <a href="http://www.hcr-manorcare.com/manorcare/WESTDESMOINES">Manor Care</a> in West Des Moines, and <a href="http://www.childserve.org/">Child Serve</a> in the des moines area. Manor Care&rsquo;s site features:</p>

<ol>
<li>A clean header</li>
<li>An intuitive vertical navigation on the left</li>
<li>A content section with a picture, a map, some description text, a search, etc.</li>
<li>A footer that contains the usual links and some really sleek design</li>
</ol>


<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not perfect, but it&rsquo;s easy and intuitive to navigate, very professional, and the design takes a backseat to the presentation of necessary information. Next up, the site for Child Serve features:</p>

<ol>
<li>A visually interesting header that focuses attention on their logo</li>
<li>A simple but very effective horizontal navigation</li>
<li>A 2 column layout that cleanly presents needed information in a condensed way</li>
<li>A flash sub-header that looks like a js script is failing to load for me</li>
</ol>


<p>This is probably the best of the three. It&rsquo;s not exactly modern in construction &ndash; there are a bunch of tables under the hood &ndash; but its look perfectly fits its content. And like Manor Care, it does a pretty decent job of presenting the necessary information.</p>

<p>So what should On With Life take from this? First: in the absence of an innovative new design that actually works for the content, it&rsquo;s probably best to stick to a more traditional layout instead of the full-width content sections. Second, more thought needs to be put into the color scheme. Child Serve does this really well, sticking to mostly blue, and only branching out into tasteful pastel colors for the header that mesh with the child-focused aesthetic. Finally, as discussed earlier, a new design should be focused heavily on presenting the important information in the most efficient and accessible way.</p>

		<p>
			Why contact me? I'm very affordable if you need work done on a project, though I won't work in exchange for part ownership of the next social media revolution.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p> 
			I'm also looking for a full time developer position. If you are hiring, I would love to talk to you. 
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Most importantly, I don't know any Nigerian Princes, so keep your spam to yourself.

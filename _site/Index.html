<div class="fp_about">

	<p>
	I'm a front-end web developer located in Iowa. My work is focused on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but I dabble in some PHP just to mix things up. I'm also passionate about design/UX and creating the best experience possible. I do my best to stay current in web trends and best practices - especially in terms of responsive design, performance optimization, and clean/semantic markup.

	<p>I'm a front-end web developer located in Iowa. My work is focused on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but I dabble in some PHP just to mix things up. I'm also passionate about design/UX and creating the best experience possible. I do my best to stay current in web trends and best practices - especially in terms of responsive design, performance optimization, and clean/semantic markup.</p>

	<p>I'm a relative newcomer to web development. I started dabbling in very basic html/css several years ago in order to create a simple site for myself. While pursuing other tech interests, I came to realize that building for the web was my true passion, because it was always what I came back to when I grew bored with other projects.</p>

		SO THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER THE HOOD, EH? FEEL FREE TO POKE AROUND!
		I TRIED TO KEEP MY CODE CLEAN, READABLE, AND WELL COMMENTED. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
		QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHOICES I HAVE MADE IN BUILDING THIS SITE, I'D GENUINELY
		LIKE TO HEAR THEM. ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, AND WANT TO DISCUSS
		EMPLOYMENT, I'D OBVIOUSLY LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. 

		I'M MOST REACHABLE AT: MICHAEL.S.DIPPOLD AT GMAIL.COM

		THANKS FOR VISITING!

	<p>I'm a front-end web developer located in Iowa. My work is focused on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but I dabble in some PHP just to mix things up. I'm also passionate about design/UX and creating the best experience possible. I do my best to stay current in web trends and best practices - especially in terms of responsive design, performance optimization, and clean/semantic markup.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I'm a relative newcomer to web development. I started dabbling in very basic html/css several years ago in order to create a simple site for myself. While pursuing other tech interests, I came to realize that building for the web was my true passion, because it was always what I came back to when I grew bored with other projects.</p>
